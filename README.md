### Short description of project
School project with the purpose of learning RESTful APIs and how to work with it in Angular2. Followed [Garys on coursetro.com](https://coursetro.com/courses/19/Learn-Angular-5-from-Scratch---Angular-5-Tutorial) to learn the basics concerning routing, components and development environment. 

Still a few concepts that need rehearsing and practice. More to come :)
